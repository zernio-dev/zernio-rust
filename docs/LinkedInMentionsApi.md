Resolve LinkedIn mention

Converts a LinkedIn profile or company URL to a URN for @mentions in posts.  **How to use LinkedIn @mentions (2-step workflow):**  1. Call this endpoint with the LinkedIn profile/company URL to get the mention URN and format. 2. Embed the returned `mentionFormat` (e.g. `@[Vincent Jong](urn:li:person:xxx)`) directly in your post's `content` field.  **Example:** - Resolve: `GET /v1/accounts/{id}/linkedin-mentions?url=linkedin.com/in/vincentjong&displayName=Vincent Jong` - Returns: `mentionFormat: \"@[Vincent Jong](urn:li:person:xxx)\"` - Use in post content: `\"Great talk with @[Vincent Jong](urn:li:person:xxx) today!\"`  **Important:** The `mentions` array field in POST /v1/posts is stored for reference only and does NOT trigger @mentions on LinkedIn. You must embed the mention format directly in the content text.  **Requirements:** - **Person mentions** require the LinkedIn account to be admin of at least one organization. This is a LinkedIn API limitation: the only endpoints that resolve profile URLs to member URNs (`vanityUrl`, `peopleTypeahead`) are scoped to organization followers. There is no public LinkedIn API to resolve a vanity URL without organization context. - **Organization mentions** (e.g. @Microsoft) work without this requirement. - For person mentions to be clickable, the `displayName` parameter must exactly match the name shown on their LinkedIn profile. - Person mentions DO work when published from personal profiles (the URN just needs to be valid). The limitation is only in the resolution step (URL to URN), not in publishing.
