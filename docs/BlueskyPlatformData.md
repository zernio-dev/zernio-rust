# BlueskyPlatformData

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**langs** | Option<**Vec<String>**> | Language(s) of the post text as 1-3 BCP-47 codes (e.g. \"pt\", \"en-US\"), written to the post record's langs field. Bluesky feed generators filter on this field, so posts without it never appear in language-scoped feeds. Can only be set at creation (Bluesky has no post editing). When threadItems is used, every item in the thread carries the same langs. When omitted, the account's default (set via PATCH /v1/accounts/{accountId}/bluesky-settings) applies; with no default either, the field is absent from the record.  | [optional]
**thread_items** | Option<[**Vec<models::TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner>**](TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner.md)> | Complete sequence of posts in a Bluesky thread. The first item becomes the root post, subsequent items are chained as replies. When threadItems is provided, the top-level content field is used only for display and search purposes, it is NOT published. You must include your first post as threadItems[0].  | [optional]
